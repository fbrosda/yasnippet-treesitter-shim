#+title: Yasnippet-Snippets: Treesitter Modes Shim

* Why
Emacs 29 provides native tree-sitter support.  But currently the functionality is
not integrated in the existing major modes, instead there exist new
~<major-mode>-ts-mode~ modes, which must explicitly be used to enjoy the new
tree-sitter based syntax highlighting.  The problem with this approach is, that
if you use e.g. ~c-ts-mode~, the yasnippet-snippets for ~c-mode~ are not
loaded.

* How
The goal is to create an easy to setup and at the same time easy to remove
workaround, as long as it is required, which needs minimal
configuration. Therefore the [[https://joaotavora.github.io/yasnippet/snippet-organization.html#org7468fa9][.yas-parents]] feature is used, to create a folder,
for each ~-ts-mode~ and link it to the snippets for the original mode.

* Setup
After cloning the repository, make sure to include this snippet repository via
#+begin_src elisp
(add-to-list 'yas-snippet-dirs "/path/to/yasnippet-treesitter-shim/snippets/")
#+end_src

If you are using [[https://github.com/radian-software/straight.el][the =straight.el= package manager]] with =use-package=,
you can use the following to achieve the same:

#+begin_src elisp
(use-package yasnippet-treesitter-shim
  :straight (:host github :repo "fbrosda/yasnippet-treesitter-shim"
                   :files ("snippets/*"))
  :no-require t
  :config
  (add-to-list 'yas-snippet-dirs
               (straight--build-dir "yasnippet-treesitter-shim")))
#+end_src
